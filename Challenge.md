Create a website that collects name, address, and zip-code from user input. Validate that the name and address are not empty. Use the attached json file to validate that the user, who lives in Germany, is providing a valid zip-code. And thereafter improve the user experience by using the attached json file to provide autocompletion for a city, which should be displayed while the user is typing. When all the fields were filled correctly, display a submit button that takes the user to a success page.

Give the user meaningful error messages
Looks and feels easy to use
Write tests that have failing and succeeding cases
Include appropriate documentation
Write meaningful commit messages matching the diff
The json file should be treated as a database
